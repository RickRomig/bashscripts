# BASH Scripts

I've been writing script for quite a while, mostly for my own edification and amusement. Often a script will come into being as a solution to a particular problem or to automate a task. I started out with DOS batch files and more recently Bash scripts. I've dabbled in several programming languages, but I haven't done much actual programming since my college days. I'm not a scripting expert or guru by any means. I'm always learning, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my scripts. To paraphrase Paul Val√©ry, the French poet, "A script is never finished, only abandoned."

I have a git server on my home network where I keep my scripts and other source code, but I share certian scripts that I feel might be useful to others on my GitHub account.

I maintain a small home network of about a dozen desktops and laptops. Most of them are older machines, some more than 10 years old. I generally don't get rid of a computer if I can get some use out of it. All of them are running Debian-based operating system (Debian, Linux Mint, and LMDE). Most of the scripts in this repository should run under other distributions, but may require a few tweaks.

All the scripts are licensed under the Gnu Public Licence, v2.0. Feel free to download and use them if you find them useful. Modify them to fit your own use cases. I don't ask that you send me any changes you make, but if you find a way to make them better, I'd appreciate you sharing them with me.

### The Scripts
