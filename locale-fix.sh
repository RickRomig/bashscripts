$script changes the setting to store locales in individual locale direectories
instead of a single archive file.

During some updates the following warning may occur:
  Warning: No support for locale: us_US.UTF-8
The problem is that /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/root_locale is expecting
to see individual locale directories in /usr/lib/locale, but locale-gen is
configured to generate an archive file by default.

Version: $version, last updated on $updated.
